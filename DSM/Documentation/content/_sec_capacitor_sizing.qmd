# Capacitor Sizing {#sec-capacitor-sizing}

The capacitance ratio in the first stage can be computed using
$$
a_1 = \frac{C_1 V_{\text{ref}}}{C_2} = \frac{C_1 V_{\text{dd}}}{C_2}
$$

The absolute value of C1 is determined by a thermal noise constraint. The meansquare
noise voltage yielding an SNR of 101 dB (98 dB plus 3 dB margin) relative to the
power of a full-scale sine wave is
$$
\overline{\nu_n^2} = \frac{(V_{dd}/2)^2/2}{10^{SNR/10}} = \frac{(0.75)^2/2}{10^{(101/10)}} = (22.3\,\mu V)^2 
$$

The in-band input-referred mean-square noise voltage associated with the first integrator is
approximately
$$
v_n^2 = \frac{kT}{OSR \cdot C_1}
$$

The c1 coefficient specifies the weighting factor connecting the first integrator to the second

$$
c_1 = \frac{C_3}{C_5}
$$

$a_2$ is related to the feedback capacitor $C_4$ and
the 1-b DACâ€™s differential reference voltage via following equation and setting $C_4 = 0.1$  picofarrad arbitraryly

$$
a_2 = \frac{C_4 V_{dd}}{C_5}
$$

This [matlab code](https://github.com/snehashree499/CEMS_DSM/blob/main/DSM/Matlab/Second_Order_SwitchCap.m) yeilds the capacitor values according to the desired equations as follows:

| Parameter  | Value | Units
|------------|-------|------
| C_1        |  0.3  | pF  
| C_2        |  2.06 | pF   
| C_3        |  0.21 | pF  
| C_4        |  0.1  | pF
| C_5        |  0.7  | pF
