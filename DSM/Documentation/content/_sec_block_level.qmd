@fig-Block-Diagram shows that we need discrete time integrators for our loop filter, 1-bit quantizer and 1-bit feedback. Before diving deep into the circuit level, let's look at our target specifications.

| Parameter           | Symbol | Value | Units |
|---------------------|--------|-------|-------|
| Signal Bandwidth           | $f_B$ | 512     | kHz   |
| Sampling frequency  | $f_{s}$ | 220     | kHz   |
| Signal-to-Noise Ratio | $SNR$    | 98    | dB    |
| Supply voltage      | $V_{dd}$ | 1.5   | V     |

## NTF Selection{#sec-NTF}

The matlab [code fragment](https://github.com/snehashree499/CEMS_DSM/blob/main/DSM/Matlab/Second_Order_SwitchCap.m)  creates an NTF and evaluates
its performance using an SQNR versus amplitude curve (see @fig-NTF)). Since the ideal peak
SQNR is 120 dB, quantization noise is 20 dB below our target noise level. This margin is
at the generous end of the 10â€“20 dB range that typically separates the ideal SQNR from
the target SNR.
