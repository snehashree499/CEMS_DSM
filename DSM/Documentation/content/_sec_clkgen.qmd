# Clock Generator 
Mixed-signal systems must balance elements that are critical in the digital domain as well as the analog domain. One important area of digital interface design in mixed-signal systems is clocking, which must be used to enforce timing between components and to read data from ADCs. Many mixed-signal systems operating in the low-to-moderate frequency range will use a reference oscillator, and there may be a need to synchronize multiple clocks across a system to accurately sample and synchronize the entire system. In designing a sigma- delta ADC, we can say that the clock is the heartbeat of the ADC, synchronizing all operations. It means that the clock plays a crucial role in the overall system operation. The clock precisely controls the timing of various ADC components, and without it, neither sampling nor processing can occur.
let's see clock's role precisely:
1. Sampling Control
The clock determines when the ADC should take a sample of the analog signal. In your system, the sampling frequency is 1 kHz, meaning a new sample is taken every 1000 microseconds.
