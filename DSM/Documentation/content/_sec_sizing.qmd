#Sizing using gm over Id method{#sec-gmid-method}

Now that we have designed the topology of our OTA(refer to foldedCascode) and 
we already know the value of $g_\mathrm{m}$, and $I_\mathrm{D}$, we need to derive the widths $W$ $L$ and lengths of our design. 

Often, transistor sizing in entry-level courses is based on the square-law model, where a simple analytical equation for the drain current can be derived. However, in nanometer CMOS, the MOSFET behavior is much more complex than these simple models. Also, this highly simplified derivations introduce concepts like the threshold voltage or the overdrive voltage, which are interesting from a theoretical viewpoint, but bear little practical use. Also this model is only valid in strong inversion. As soon as the gate-source voltage gets smaller, the square-law model breaks, as the drain current component based on diffusion currents gets dominant. Modern compact MOSFET models (like the PSP model used in SG13G2) use hundreds of parameters and fairly complex equations to somewhat properly describe MOSFET behavior over a wide range of parameters like width, length and temperature. A modern approach to MOSFET sizing is thus based on the thought to use exactly these MOSFET models, characterize them, put the resulting data into tables and charts, and thus learn about the complex MOSFET behavior and use it for MOSFET sizing.

The gm over Id methodology has the huge advantage that it catches MOSFET behavior quite accurately over a wide range of operating conditions, and the curves look very similar for pretty much all CMOS technologies, from micrometer bulk CMOS down to nanometer FinFET devices. Of course the absolute values change, but the method applies universally.
