@fig-schematic-ltspice shows the schematic entry in **LTSpice** which acts as a reference to our circuit

@fig-schematic-dsm shows the implementation of real circuit , where the designed switch capacitor using OTA and comparator are put together in **Xschem**. @fig-ltspice-output is the reference output from **LTSpice**

@fig-ltspice-output gives us the reference plot and @fig-real-dsm-output is the output of our real circuit which portrays that the switch capacitor block is working perfectly fine as we can see the plot till $60\mu$ in @fig-ltspice-output and compare it with @fig-real-dsm-output  but the comparator output is always staying in upper saturation. Our team is working in order to resolve the issue with the comparator. 

We can further analyse the output behaviour of switch capacitor block by looking at the @fig-20m-SC.

The current status of the output from dsm is shown in @fig-dsm-output
