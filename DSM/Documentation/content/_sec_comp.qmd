## Designing the 1-Bit Quantiser
Based on the collected experience in this lecture we are desiging a 1-bit Quantiser (Comparator) in Xschem. 
Below is the prepared comparator design which will be discused in detail next.

## Comparator

It is a block which takes two inputs V1 and V2 and finds weatehr ${V_\mathrm{1}}$ < ${V_\mathrm{2}}$ or ${V_\mathrm{1}}$ > ${V_\mathrm{2}}$. If ${V_\mathrm{1}}$ > ${V_\mathrm{2}}$ then output is ${V_\mathrm{DD}}$ or the output will be 0.

The ideal input-output chracteristics should look like a signum function.

## Designing a comparator

Consider a amplier with a sufficiently large gain. For simplicity consider one input ${V_\mathrm{in}}$, the output is going to be amplified by factor A. Amplifier operates between ${V_\mathrm{DD}}$ and GND. If the gain is large emough the output will saturate to ${V_\mathrm{DD}}$ or GND. 


The minimum input for which the output will be ${V_\mathrm{DD}}$ here is ${V_\mathrm{DD}}$/$A$
