@fig-schematic-ltspice shows the schematic entry in **LTSpice** which acts as a reference to our circuit

@fig-ltspice-output is the output from **LTSpice** which is taken as reference. @fig-schematic-dsm shows the implementation of real circuit , where the designed switch capacitor using OTA and comparator are put together in **Xschem**. **vo1** representing the output from first integrator, **vo2** from second integrator, and **vcmp** from the comparator, which then creates a feedback loop.

@fig-ltspice-output gives us the reference plot and @fig-real-dsm-output is the output of our real circuit which portrays that the switch capacitor block is working perfectly fine as we can see the plot till $60\mu$ in @fig-ltspice-output and compare it with @fig-real-dsm-output  

We can further analyse the output behaviour of switch capacitor block by looking at the @fig-20m-SC.

The current status of the output from dsm is shown in @fig-dsm-output
